  <h2>Lyrically Accurate Lime-Coconut</h2>
    <p>An ingenious Lime-Coconut (or Coconut-Lime if you prefer) invention straight from the mind of<br>
        that one guy. Feel free to sing along as you prepare what can only be described as a useless<br>
        waste of food from one of the most annoying songs ever written. Not only is our Lime-Coconut<br>
        organic in the strictest sense of the word, but, as prepared, it's also zero calorie! **
    </p>


    <!-- Under the description text, add an ingredients header followed by an unordered list of ingredients-->
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small lime</li>
      <li>1 coconut</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- Under the ingredients, add a steps header followed by an ordered list of steps-->
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut your coconut into two halves. This may require a knife, or a hammer, or a drill, or any<br>
        number of tools really. Seriously, we don't really know how to do this. So good luck.
      </li>

      <br>
      
      <li>Pick up your lime.</li>
      
      <br>
      
      <li>Place your lime <strong><em>inside</em></strong> one half of the coconut.</li>

      <br>
      
      <li>Place the other half of the coconut on top of the coconut half containing the lime, like a lid.</li>
      
      <br>
      
      <li>Vigorously shake the lime-coconut system.</li>
      
      <br>
      
      <li>Continue shaking the lime-coconut until all has been made better.</li>

    </ol>
