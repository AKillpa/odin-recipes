  <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>Are you looking for a poorly coded website containing recipes that are of questionable use, or <br>
      recipes with clearly superior alternatives? You've come to the right place. Herein lies a laughably<br>
      small collection of recipes of very little value, displayed in the most novice way possible. Enjoy!

    <ul>
        <li>In the mood for a subway sandwich? Too lazy to go to the store and buy some rolls, yet<br>
          paradoxically motivated enough to make your own rolls from scratch? Try making these<br>
          "delicious"<a href="./recipes/pretzel-bread.html"> pretzel rolls.</a> After making these rolls, you'll never take mass-produced bread<br>
          for granted again! Guaranteed!
        </li>

        <li>Looking for a recipe that begs the question "what even is this?" Then look no further. This<br>
          wonderful <a href = "./recipes/lime-in-coconut.html">coconut contraption</a> will have you <br>
          singing in just 6 easy steps!</li>
