  <h2>Subway style Pretzel Sandwich Rolls</h2>
    <p>Pretzel rolls that can be made start to finish in under 1.5 hours, and are great for any type of<br>
      subway sandwich or Philly cheesesteak. The dough can also be formed into hamburger style buns, or<br>
      dinner rolls, if preferred. The dough takes 20 minutes to prepare, and 25 minutes to bake, with a<br>
      rise time of roughly 1 hour. Makes 8 sandwich rolls.
    </p>

  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix and knead the dough mixture using whatever preferred method. Knead dough until smooth and<br>
        slightly sticky.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Lightly grease a large bowl. Place the dough inside and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise for<br>
        1 hour. Note: the dough will roughly double in volume.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Gently deflate the dough and transfer to a lightly greased work surface.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Divide the dough into 8 sections and shape each section into a ball.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Flatten each ball into 6" discs, then roll each disc into a log shape. Pinch the seams and edges<br>
        closed in order to seal the logs. Shape the logs into sandwich rolls by gently flattening them with<br>
        both hands.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Let the rolls rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Prepare the water bath by bringing the water, salt, and baking soda to a boil in a large pot.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Drop as many of the rolls into the water bath as can fit without overcrowding the pot. Cook each<br>
        side for 30 seconds before removing with a slotted spoon and placing on a greased baking sheet.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Using a knife, cut a 1/2 inch deep line across the length of each roll. Sprinkle with coarse sea<br>
        salt.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Bake the buns for 20 to 24 minutes, or until they are a deep, dark-brown. Remove from the oven and<br>
        let cool.
      </li>
    </ol>
